# all the sql files and associated resource files lie at the same directory               

A brief statement of the scatter plot:
The average course byte-size of the 300 and 400 level is larger than that of the 500 level, which means that 
students with lower level and ages require more instructions and more user-friendly guidelines compared to those
with higher level and ages. This is reasonable because students of higher degree and level tend to be more experienced 
and more capable to tackle tough problems and details on their own.

A brief description of R:
The first line indicates the mean(i.e. average) value of all the second column elements in courselist file, that is the average byte-size of all the 
web pages downloaded successfully
The second line indicates which jpeg device is opened(here is the null device)
The third line means shutting down device 1(i.e. null device) successfully
